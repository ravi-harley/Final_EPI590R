This file is Ravi Harley's final project for EPI 590 R. 

To run the project you may need to load the necessary packages (here, ggplot2, broom, dplyr, readr)

Objectives are laid out in the order that they were requested from the assignment but some are integrated throught the code. 

Rendering the document should produce the necessary captions.
